# VIM DOT FILES

The config is set up to work with python 3, so be sure to have that fixed!
*This should not be much of problem now.*

For installation install vim-plug and run `:PlugInstall`

## FZF
Be sure to install fzf by homebrew, run `brew install fzf`
or some other way.

## Language Servers
To actually use the whole config you should install the language servers
mentioned in the config or update the config.
